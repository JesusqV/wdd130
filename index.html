        <p>Welcome to my homepage. I would like you to get to know me better, so I will introduce myself to you.</p>
        <p>I am from where the children of the Sun are born, where we are indigenous because we are natives of the land,
            where 48
            languages are still spoken. I am from where the food is delicious in any region, whether it be the coast,
            the mountains,
            or the jungle. I proudly answer that I am from Lima, Peru.</p>
        <p>My hobbies would be:</p>
        <p>Spending time with friends until we get sleepy, I am passionate about music, going out
            and enjoying any adventure.</p>
