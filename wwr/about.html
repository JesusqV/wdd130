                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    Our story began with a group of friends who were passionate about rivers and mountains, who found in
                    rafting not only an
                    adventure, but a way to connect with nature and with people. What started as an outing among friends
                    turned into a life
                    project: to create a company dedicated to sharing that excitement with everyone. Over time, we have
                    grown in terms of
                    routes, team, and experience, but we maintain the same spirit that drove us from day one: paddling
                    together toward
                    adventure.
