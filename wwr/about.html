            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Our story began with a group of friends who were passionate about rivers and mountains, who found in
                rafting not only an adventure, but a way to connect with nature and with people. What started as an
                outing among friends turned into a life project: to create a company dedicated to sharing that
                excitement with everyone. Over time, we have grown in terms of routes, team, and experience, but we
                maintain the same spirit that drove us from day one: paddling together toward adventure.
