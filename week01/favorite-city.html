    <h1>Lehi</h1>
    <p>I don't think I have anything bad to say about Lehi. In the two years I've been living here, I haven't had
        any problems. Almost all the places I visit are nearby, and I have regular services very close to home. I like
        the
        safety of the communities, and I think I could say that I plan to continue living here for a long time to come.
